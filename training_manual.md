*   **FDA Guidance:** Draft Guidance on Epinephrine (referencing population bioequivalence).

### 1.3. Equipment

*   High-precision analytical balance (readability to 0.01 mg).
*   Beakers or other suitable containers for collecting the dose.
*   Temperature and humidity controlled test environment.

### 1.4. Sample Size and Method

*   **Sample Size:** A minimum of 30 devices from each of three different manufacturing batches should be tested.
*   **Method:** Samples should be randomly selected from each batch.

### 1.5. Procedure

1.  Acclimatize the devices to the controlled test environment for at least 4 hours.
2.  Record the weight of an empty, dry collection container.
3.  Activate the auto-injector, dispensing the full dose into the pre-weighed container.
4.  Record the weight of the container with the delivered drug.
5.  Calculate the net weight of the delivered drug.
6.  Convert the net weight to volume using the known density of the epinephrine solution.
7.  Repeat for all test samples.

### 1.6. Acceptance Criteria

*   The delivered volume of each device must be within ±10% of the label claim (e.g., 0.3 mL ± 0.03 mL).
*   The mean delivered volume for each batch should be within ±5% of the label claim.
*   The results must meet the criteria for population bioequivalence (PBE) when compared to a reference listed drug (RLD).

### 1.7. Justification and Collaboration

*   **Justification:** This test directly addresses a critical safety parameter. An incorrect dose could lead to treatment failure or adverse events. It is a direct requirement from the FDA.
*   **Collaboration:**
    *   **Summed Medtech:** Responsible for the overall device design and performance, ensuring the delivery mechanism is consistent.
    *   **Stevanato (PFS Supplier):** Must provide syringes with consistent dimensions and silicone lubrication to ensure smooth plunger movement and complete delivery.
    *   **Pharma Customer A:** Must ensure the filling process is accurate and precise. The filling volume error directly impacts the delivered dose. Close collaboration on the acceptable range of filling volumes is essential.

## 3. Injection Time and Needle Exposure

### 3.1. Objective

To verify that the injection is completed within an appropriate time frame and that the needle is exposed for the correct duration to ensure proper drug delivery.

### 3.2. Referenced Standards

*   **ISO 11608-1:** Needle-based injection systems for medical use — Requirements and test methods — Part 1: Needle-based injection systems.

### 3.3. Equipment
