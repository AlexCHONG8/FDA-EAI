Contains Nonbinding Recommendations Draft – Not for Implementation

Draft Guidance on Epinephrine May 2025

This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, or the Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the Office of Generic Drugs.

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

# Active Ingredient:

Epinephrine

# Dosage Form:

Aerosol, metered

# Route:

Inhalation

# Strength:

0.125 mg/inh

# Recommended Studies:

Two options: (1) six in vitro bioequivalence studies and one in vivo bioequivalence study with pharmacokinetic endpoints, or (2) five in vitro bioequivalence studies, one in vivo bioequivalence study with pharmacokinetic endpoints, and one comparative clinical endpoint bioequivalence study

# I. Option 1: Six in vitro bioequivalence studies and one in vivo bioequivalence study with pharmacokinetic endpoints

To demonstrate bioequivalence by this option, the test (T) product should contain no difference in inactive ingredients or in other aspects of the formulation relative to the reference standard (RS) that may significantly affect the local or systemic availability of the active ingredient. For example, the T product can be qualitatively (Q1)1 and quantitatively $( \mathbf { Q } 2 ) ^ { 2 }$ the same as the RS to satisfy no difference in inactive ingredients.

# Six in vitro bioequivalence studies:

FDA recommends that prospective applicants conduct the following in vitro bioequivalence studies for the T product and RS. Use at least three batches each of the T product and RS, with no fewer than 10 units from each batch. FDA recommends that three primary stability batches be also used to demonstrate in vitro bioequivalence. The three batches of T product should be manufactured from, at a minimum, three different batches of drug substances, excipients, and device constituent part components. The T product should consist of the final device constituent part and final drug constituent formulation intended to be marketed.

1. Type of study: Single actuation content (SAC) Design: The SAC test should be performed at the beginning (B), middle (M), and end (E) lifestages3 of the product, using a flow rate of $2 8 . 3 \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ or $3 0 \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ .4 U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP) ${ \it - 6 0 1 > }$ Apparatus A or other appropriate apparatus may be used to determine the SAC using a validated assay. The number of actuations per determination should be one.

Equivalence based on: Population bioequivalence (PBE) analysis of SAC. Refer to the most recent version of the FDA product-specific guidance for Budesonide Inhalation Suspension (NDA 020929)a for additional information regarding PBE analysis procedures.

2. Type of study: Aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) Design: The APSD test should be performed at the B and E lifestages of the product using a flow rate of $2 8 . 3 \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ or $3 0 \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ . A cascade impactor apparatus for inhalation aerosols as per USP ${ \it - 6 0 1 > }$ Table 2 or other appropriate method may be used to determine APSD using a validated assay. The APSD determination of each unit should be performed with a minimum number of actuations justified by the sensitivity of the validated assay.

Additional comments: Drug deposition on individual sites, including the mouthpiece adapter, the induction port, each stage of the cascade impactor, and the filter, is requested. Mass balance accountability should be reported based on the sum of all deposition sites. For electronic submission of the individual cascade impactor data for the T and RS products, provide a table using the format in the appendix and send them as part of the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) submission.

Equivalence based on: PBE analysis of impactor-sized mass (ISM) of the drug. 5 The cascade impactor profiles representing drug deposition on the individual stages of the cascade impactor along with the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), geometric standard deviation (GSD) and fine particle mass (FPM) should be submitted as supportive evidence for equivalent APSD.

3. Type of study: Spray pattern

Design: The spray pattern test should be performed at the B lifestage of the product at two different distances from the actuator orifice. The selected distances should be at least $3 \mathrm { c m }$ apart and based on the range of 3 to $7 \mathrm { c m }$ from the RS actuator mouthpiece. 6 Impaction (thin-layer chromatography plate impaction), non-impaction (laser light sheet technology), or other suitable method may be used to determine the spray pattern.

Additional comments: The spray pattern test should be measured quantitatively in terms of ovality ratio and area within the parameter of the true shape (to include a high proportion, e.g., $9 5 \%$ of the total pattern) for the automated analysis or ovality ratio and $\operatorname { D } _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ for the manual analysis. Ovality ratio is defined as the ratio of $\operatorname { D } _ { \operatorname* { m a x } }$ to $ { \mathrm { D } } _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ . Dmax and $ { \mathrm { D } } _ { \mathrm { m i n } }$ are the longest and shortest diameters, respectively, that pass through the center of mass or the center of gravity, as appropriate. The number of sprays per spray pattern would preferably be one.

Equivalence based on: At two selected distances, (i) qualitative comparison of spray shape, and (ii) PBE analysis of ovality ratio and area within the perimeter of the true shape or ovality ratio and $ { \mathrm { D } } _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ .

4. Type of study: Plume geometry

Design: The plume geometry test should be performed at the B lifestage of the product. The timed-sequence sound-triggered flash photography method, laser light sheet technology, or other suitable method may be used to determine the plume geometry at the appropriate post-actuation delay time.

Additional comments: Plume geometry measurements should be reported at a single delay time while the fully developed plume is still in contact with the actuator mouthpiece. Plume geometry should be measured quantitatively in terms of plume angle and width. The plume angle is based on the conical region of the plume extending from the vertex that occurs at or near the actuator mouthpiece. The plume width is measured at a distance equal to the greater of the two distances selected for characterization of the spray pattern.

Equivalence based on: Ratio of the geometric mean of the three batches of T to that of the three batches of RS (based on log transformed data) for plume angle and width, which should fall within $9 0 \% - 1 1 1 \%$ .

5. Type of study: Priming and repriming

Design: The priming and repriming tests should be based on the emitted dose (exactuator) of a single actuation immediately following the specified number of priming or repriming actuations specified in the reference listed drug (RLD) labeling. The repriming test should be performed following storage for the specified period of non-use after initial use and/or other conditions (e.g., dropping), if the RLD labeling provides such repriming information.

Additional comments: For the bioequivalence evaluation, the priming and repriming tests should be based on products stored in the valve upright position, with the exception of metered dose inhalers (MDIs) for which the RLD labeling recommends storage in the valve down position. The priming data can be based on the SAC data at the B lifestage.

Equivalence based on: PBE analysis of the emitted dose of a single actuation immediately following the specified number of priming or repriming actuations specified in the RLD labeling.

6. Type of study: Realistic APSD

Design: The realistic APSD test should be performed at the B lifestage of the product using mouth-throat models of different sizes (e.g., small and large) and breathing profiles (e.g., weak and strong) that are representative of the entire patient population. A cascade impactor apparatus for inhalation aerosols as per USP ${ \it - 6 0 1 > }$ Table 2 or another appropriate method may be used to determine APSD using a validated assay. The APSD determination of each unit should be performed with a minimum number of actuations justified by the sensitivity of the validated assay.

Additional comments: Drug deposition on individual sites, including the mouthpiece adapter, the mouth-throat model, the mixing inlet, and each stage of the cascade impactor and the filter, is requested. Mass balance accountability should be reported based on the sum of all deposition sites. For electronic submission of the individual cascade impactor data for the T product and RS, provide a table using the format in the appendix, and send them as part of the ANDA submission.

Equivalence based on: PBE analysis or other appropriate statistical analysis of ISM of the drugs for each mouth-throat model-breathing profile combination. The cascade impactor profiles representing drug deposition on the individual stages of the cascade impactor along with the MMAD, GSD, and FPM should be submitted as supportive evidence for equivalent APSD. If another statistical analysis is used, it should be adequately and scientifically justified considering the purpose of the study. Prospective applicants are encouraged to discuss other statistical analysis designs with FDA via a preANDA meeting request. For additional information, refer to the most recent version of the FDA guidance for industry on Formal Meetings Between FDA and ANDA Applicants of Complex Products Under GDUFA. b

# One in vivo bioequivalence study with pharmacokinetic endpoints:

1. Type of study: Fasting

Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover   
Dose: Minimum number of inhalations that is sufficient to characterize a   
pharmacokinetic profile by using a sensitive analytical method   
Subjects: Healthy males and non-pregnant females   
Additional comments: (1) Since epinephrine is an endogenous substance, the plasma concentrations of epinephrine should be corrected for baseline endogenous levels by subtracting the mean pre-dose baseline value (average of at least three pre-dose values, e.g., $^ { - 1 }$ , -0.5, and 0 hours). Any negative values obtained from baseline correction at time 0 hour should be designated as zero (0) and any subject with pre-dose concentration more than $5 \%$ of their $\mathrm { { C } _ { \mathrm { { m a x } } } }$ should be excluded from bioequivalence statistical analysis and the $90 \%$ confidence intervals (CIs) based on the remaining subjects. Both baseline corrected and baseline uncorrected data should be submitted in the application. (2) Subjects enrolled for in vivo studies should be trained in the use of the inhalation aerosols in a standard fashion, prior to each treatment session, to assure a relatively consistent inspiratory flow rate and inspiratory duration. (3) A Bio-IND is required prior to conduct of the pharmacokinetic study if the dose exceeds the maximum labeled single-dose.

Analyte to measure: Epinephrine in plasma

Bioequivalence based on $9 0 \%$ CI): Baseline-corrected epinephrine

# II. Option 2: Five in vitro bioequivalence studies, one in vivo bioequivalence study with pharmacokinetic endpoints, and one comparative clinical endpoint bioequivalence study

To demonstrate bioequivalence by this option, it is recommended to conduct the in vitro bioequivalence studies #1 through #5 and the in vivo pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study as described in Option 1. In addition, it is recommended to conduct the comparative clinical endpoint bioequivalence study, described below.

# One comparative clinical endpoint bioequivalence study:

1. Type of study: Comparative clinical endpoint bioequivalence study Design: This study could be either of crossover or parallel-group design, taking into consideration the patient population, the current standard-of-care treatment for asthma and should include appropriate justification for the design chosen. The study should be randomized, single-dose, blinded (where possible) and placebo-controlled, at minimum consisting of a 2-week run-in period followed by a one-day treatment period of the placebo, T product, or RS. Strength: $0 . 1 2 5 \mathrm { m g / i n h }$ Dose: $0 . 1 2 5 ~ \mathrm { m g }$ , single dose (i.e., one inhalation) Subjects: Males and non-pregnant females with asthma

Inclusion criteria should, at minimum, include:

a. Adult male or female subjects of non-childbearing or of childbearing potential committing to consistent and correct use of an acceptable method of birth control.   
b. Diagnosis of mild to severe asthma as defined by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, at least 12 months prior to screening.   
c. Pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second $\mathrm { ( F E V _ { 1 } ) o f } \ge 5 0 . 0$ and $\leq 8 5 . 0 \%$ of predicted normal value during the screening visit and on the first day of treatment.   
d. Reversible airway obstruction as demonstrated by an improvement of $1 5 \%$ or more in $\mathrm { F E V } _ { 1 } 3 0$ minutes after two inhalations $2 \mathrm { ~ x ~ } 0 . 1 2 5 \mathrm { ~ m g } )$ of RS inhalation aerosol, metered.   
e. Patients should be stable on their chronic asthma treatment regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.   
f. Currently non-smoking; had not used tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco) within the past year, and having had $\leq 1 0$ pack-years of historical use.   
g. Ability to replace current short-acting $\beta$ -agonist (SABA) with salbutamol/albuterol inhaler for use as needed for the duration of the study (subjects should be able to withhold all inhaled SABAs for at least 6 hours prior to lung function assessments on study visits).   
h. Ability to discontinue their asthma medications (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting $\beta \mathrm { . }$ -agonists) during the run-in period and for remainder of the study.   
i. Willingness to give their written informed consent to participate in the study.

Exclusion criteria should, at minimum, include:

a. Life-threatening asthma, defined as a history of an asthma episode(s) requiring intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures, asthma related syncopal episode(s), or hospitalizations within the past year prior to the screening or during the run-in period.   
b. Significant respiratory disease other than asthma (e.g., COPD, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis).   
c. Evidence of respiratory tract infection within six weeks prior to the study.   
d. Evidence or history of clinically significant disease or abnormality including: congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. In addition, historical or current evidence of significant hematologic, hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric, renal, or other diseases that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at risk through study participation, or would affect the study analyses if the disease exacerbates during the study.   
e. Asthma exacerbations that required emergency care or hospitalized treatment within 4 weeks prior to screening.   
f. Patients receiving non-selective $\beta$ -blockers, anti-arrhythmics, anti-depressants, and/or monoamine oxidase inhibitors within 4 weeks prior to the screening.   
g. Hypersensitivity to any sympathomimetic drug (e.g., albuterol) or any inhaled, intranasal, or systemic corticosteroid therapy of the excipients in the study drugs or rescue medication formulation.

h. Patients receiving systemic, oral, parenteral, or depot corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive medications within 4 weeks prior to screening and during the study.

Additional comments: a. The study may enroll all asthma patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, or may be enriched by using a subpopulation of patients predicted to respond well to the study treatment (appropriate justification should be included for the population chosen for study). b. Subjects who discontinue from the study early should be identified, and the protocol should clearly prospectively state how missing data will be handled in the statistical analyses and provide appropriate justification for the method chosen. The protocol should also include subject retention strategies and other plans to minimize missing data. If there are missing data, adequate justification should be provided that the missing data do not lead to biased equivalence determination. Detailed information for all subjects who are discontinued from the study should be provided. c. All spirometry should be conducted in accordance with American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards. d. The study is recommended to begin with a placebo run-in period (at least two weeks in duration; appropriate justification should be included for the duration chosen) to allow for washout of anticholinergic agents, chronic long-acting betaagonists, and chronic inhaled corticosteroids to establish $\mathrm { F E V _ { 1 } }$ baseline values. e. The study protocol should include pre-specified definitions of asthma exacerbation, as well as pre-specified and appropriate escape criteria with consideration to patient safety. f. To ensure adequate study sensitivity, the T product and RS should both be statistically superior to placebo $( \mathrm { p } { < } 0 . 0 5 )$ with regard to the bioequivalence study endpoint. g. It is the prospective applicant’s responsibility to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for the study to demonstrate bioequivalence of the T product to the RS. h. A clear list of permitted and restricted medications should be provided, including justification for use (or restriction) of certain classes of respiratory therapies, considering the current standard of care for asthma. i. The start and stop date of concomitant medication use during the study should be provided in the data set in addition to the reason for the medication use. The prospective applicant should clearly explain whether the medication was used prior to baseline visit, during the study or both. j. All adverse events (AEs) should be reported, whether or not they are considered to be related to the treatment. The report of each AE should include the date of onset, description of AE, severity, relation to study medication, action taken, outcome, and date of resolution. The information will assist FDA in determining whether the incidence and severity of adverse reactions is different between the T product and RS. k. Refer to the most recent version of the FDA product-specific guidance on Adapalene; Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel (NDA 207917)a for a recommended approach to statistical analysis and study design for bioequivalence studies with clinical endpoints.

Bioequivalence study primary endpoint: Area under the serial $\mathrm { F E V } _ { 1 } .$ -time curve calculated from time zero to 4 hours (AUC0-4h) following the treatment.

The above bioequivalence study endpoint should be baseline-adjusted (change from baseline). $\mathrm { F E V _ { 1 } }$ measurements should be performed and interpreted in accordance with ATS guidelines.

Serial spirometry (FEV1) should be measured at 0, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes, and 3 and 4 hours post-dose.

Equivalence based on: T/R ratio for the primary endpoint. The $90 \%$ CIs for the T/R ratio for the bioequivalence study endpoint should fall within $8 0 . 0 0 \% - 1 2 5 . 0 0 \%$ .

# Additional information:

An optional computational modeling study may be used to support bioequivalence of the T product and RS. Refer to the most recent version of the FDA product-specific guidance on Formoterol Fumarate; Glycopyrrolate Inhalation Metered Aerosol (NDA 208294)a for additional information regarding the development and conduct of an optional computational modeling study.

In order to clarify the FDA’s expectations for prospective applicants early in product development, and to assist applicants to submit an ANDA as complete as possible, FDA strongly encourages applicants to discuss their development program and plans for conducting an optional computational modeling study with the FDA via the pre-ANDA meeting pathway. For additional information, refer to the most recent version of the FDA guidance for industry on Formal Meetings Between FDA and ANDA Applicants of Complex Products Under GDUFA. b

Device:

The RLD is presented as a MDI. The device constituent parts are the actuator and the canister with metering valve.

FDA recommends that prospective applicants examine the size and shape, the external critical design attributes, and the external operating principles of the RLD device when designing the T device including:

• Active, metered, multi-dose format • Number of doses • Dose indicator/counter

User interface assessment:

An ANDA for this product should include complete comparative analyses so FDA can determine whether any differences in design for the user interface of the proposed generic product, as compared to the RLD, are acceptable and whether the product can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile as the RLD when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling. For additional information, refer to the most recent version of the FDA guidance for industry on Comparative Analyses and Related Comparative Use Human Factors Studies for a Drug-Device Combination Product Submitted in an ANDA. b
