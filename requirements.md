# Requirements for Epinephrine Auto-Injector Functional Testing

This document outlines the high-level requirements for the functional testing of the Summed Medtech epinephrine auto-injector. The tests are designed to ensure the device is safe, effective, and compliant with FDA regulations.

## 1. Dose Accuracy and Delivered Volume

- The auto-injector shall deliver the correct dose of epinephrine with a high degree of accuracy and precision.
- The delivered volume shall be measured and analyzed using population bioequivalence (PBE) analysis as recommended by the FDA.
- The test shall account for variations in manufacturing, including the filling volume error from Pharma Customer A.

## 2. Activation Force and User Handling

- The force required to activate the auto-injector shall be within a range that is manageable for the target patient population, including individuals with reduced hand strength.
- The device shall be easy to handle and use, with intuitive steps for administration.
- The design shall minimize the risk of use errors.

## 3. Injection Time and Needle Exposure

- The injection time shall be sufficient to deliver the full dose of epinephrine but short enough to be practical in an emergency situation.
- The needle shall penetrate to the correct intramuscular depth and remain in place for the required duration.
- The needle shall be shielded before and after use to prevent accidental needlesticks.

## 4. Device Durability and Robustness

- The auto-injector shall be able to withstand normal handling and environmental conditions without damage or degradation of performance.
- The device shall be tested for durability against dropping, vibration, and temperature variations.
- The safety features of the device shall remain functional after exposure to stress conditions.

## 5. Container Closure Integrity (CCI)

- The pre-filled syringe (PFS) from Stevanato, as integrated into the auto-injector, shall maintain a sterile barrier.
- There shall be no leakage of the drug product from the container closure system.
- The CCI shall be maintained throughout the shelf life of the product.
